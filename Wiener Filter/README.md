# Using Wiener Filter to filter out speckle noise #

Wiener filter uses the statistical characteristics of a given signal X and a given noise N.
when X and V are statistically independent (uncorrelated), the filter formula is given by:

where Sx and Sv are the power spectral density functions (PSD) of X and.
